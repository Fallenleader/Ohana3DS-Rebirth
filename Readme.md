## **Ohana3DS Special Pikachu Edition**

### **What is Ohana3DS?**

Ohana3DS is a work in progress tool used to view, extract, and ultimately replace data from decrypted 3DS roms.

Examples of such are the ability to view Models, Textures, even some animations.

Ohana3DS aims to be a one stop shop for all 3DS rom viewing, extracting, editing needs.

### **What is the difference in this version?**

This version incorporates different patches and fixes explicitly geared towards extracting models, animations, and anything else pokemon related.

While I will attempt to push changes from vanilla Ohana on a regular basis, this should only be a last resort measure.

It should also be understood that this tool becomes completely obsolete when vanilla fully addresses many of its current issues that makes this version special for pokemon games.
